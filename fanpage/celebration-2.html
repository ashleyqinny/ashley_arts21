		<h3>The goal of tidying is to make room for meaningful objects, people and experiences – only you can know what kind of environment makes you happy. In the KonMari Method™, your feelings are the standard for decision making – specifically, knowing what sparks joy. Joy is personal, so everyone will experience it differently.</h3>
