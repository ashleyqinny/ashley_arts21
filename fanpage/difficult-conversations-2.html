			<h2>Having conversations with family, friends, and relatives</h2>
			<h3>There are many ways to be an ally and champion solutions for social change: donating, sharing resources, signing petitions, and fostering conversation with friends, family, and neighbors about racism. Raw, honest communication about the impact of racism is powerful, but you may not know exactly where to start. Initiating a conversation about racism can be challenging, but it doesn't have to be.<br>
			<br>
			- It can start with a simple text check-in.<br>
			- You don’t need to do extensive research or prep first.<br>
			- Share how you’re feeling and be respectful of other perspectives.<br>
			- It can be helpful to bring a small group together.<br>
			- Be an active listener and show you’re engaged.<br>
			- Stay consistent in your communication.</h3>
